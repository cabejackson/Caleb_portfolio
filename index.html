				<h3>About Me:</h3>
				  <p>I am fascinated with the intersection of software engineering and personal development. I plan to work on a team that brings the benefits of technology to everyday people. For example, I would love to work on an App similar to Youper, which tracks your emotions and gives you advice/feedback throughout your day. These “insights” help users identify what aspects during their day lead to certain feelings and improve their overall well-being.</p>
          <hr>
          <p>On a similar, but seperate note: I would like to work in a STEM museum. While studying neuroscience, I have taken a keen interest in childhood development, so I would love to take my skills into a kids musuem. Specifically, I could see myself working well with a team of engineers responsible for creating the digital object labels. Object labels are the plaques next to paintings that explain what you're looking at. Oftentimes, object lables aren't very eye-catching, but I would love to make these more interactive and kid-friendly, by incorporating animations and interesting content.</p>
